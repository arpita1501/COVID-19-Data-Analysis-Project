COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

The COVID-19 pandemic brought about significant challenges in the whole world , that makes it crucial 
for analyze related data for insights and future preparedness. This project that we have made focused on 
examining a real-world dataset containing COVID-19 case information of India, aiming to uncover 
trends and develop predictive models.  
We started by preparing the dataset using Python and Microsoft Excel. This step involved cleaning the 
data by first removing duplicate entries, addressing missing values, and standardizing column names 
ensuring smooth analysis. The initial stage of analysis involved tracking the progression of confirmed 
cases, recoveries, and fatalities over time. Through line charts, we visualized how the virus spread and 
how its impact changed, offering a clear picture of the situation's evolution.  
Next, we transitioned into predictive modeling using various machine learning techniques. We 
implemented Linear Regression to estimate the number of deaths based on confirmed cases, which 
helped in identifying a trend line that indicated how fatalities increased in relation to rising infections. 
Following this, Logistic Regression was used in classifying whether a given day experienced a high 
death toll. We used confirmed and recovered cases as input features, allowing the model for estimating 
the likelihood of a day recording elevated death counts.  
Further, we experimented with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for 
better classification. With SVM, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality 
reduction, which enabled us to visualize the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between different classes. The 
KNN model was employed to predict if a day recorded an above-average number of confirmed cases 
using variables like deaths, recoveries, and foreign cases.All models were trained and validated using 
standard evaluation techniques. We assessed their performance with tools such as confusion matrices, 
classification reports, and accuracy scores to ensure reliability.  
In summary, this project leveraged real-time COVID-19 data and applied data preprocessing, 
visualization, and machine learning techniques to understand patterns and forecast potential scenarios. 
Such analyses are crucial in supporting data-driven decision-making during health crises.
